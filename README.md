# wsl2-dev

Expose your Wsl2 Host to your local network to connect with other Devices in your local net. This script has to run as Andministrator in Windows.

To run the Script you have to check the State of Get-ExecutionPolicy. If it's restricted you can set that local Scripts are running via Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned.

So you can just add Let's encrypr Wildcard Certificates on your Wsl2.
